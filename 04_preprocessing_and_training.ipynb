    "In preceding notebooks, performed preliminary assessments of data quality and refined the question to be answered. You found a small number of data values that gave clear choices about whether to replace values or drop a whole row. You determined that predicting the adult weekend ticket price was your primary aim. You threw away records with missing price data, but not before making the most of the other available data to look for any patterns between the states. You didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally; the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful.\n",

    "In this notebook you'll start to build machine learning models. Before even starting with learning a machine learning model, however, start by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. This is more than just a pedagogical device. You never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Your first model is a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. You then build up the process of efficiently and robustly creating and assessing models against it. The development we lay out may be little slower than in the real world, but this step of the capstone is definitely more than just instructional. It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

    "So far, you've treated ski resort data as a single entity. In machine learning, when you train your model on all of your data, you end up with no data set aside to evaluate model performance. You could keep making more and more complex models that fit the data better and better and not realise you were overfitting to that one set of samples. By partitioning the data into training and testing splits, without letting a model (or missing-value imputation) learn anything about the test split, you have a somewhat independent assessment of how your model might perform in the future. An often overlooked subtlety here is that people all too frequently use the test set to assess model performance _and then compare multiple models to pick the best_. This means their overall model selection process is  fitting to one specific data set, now the test split. You could keep going, trying to get better and better performance on that one data set, but that's  where cross-validation becomes especially useful. While training models, a test split is very useful as a final check on expected future performance."

If you continue this way you'll end up with a model works well on the particular quirks of our test set _but fails to generalize to new data_. The whole point of keeping a test set is for it to be a set of that new data, to check how well our model might perform on data it hasn't seen.\n",

Thus you end up building k models on k sets of data with k estimates of how the model performs on unseen data but without having to touch the test set."

    "These results suggest that vertical drop is your biggest positive feature. This makes intuitive sense and is consistent with what you saw during the EDA work. Also, you see the area covered by snow making equipment is a strong positive as well. People like guaranteed skiing! The skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price! This seems odd. People will pay less for larger resorts? There could be all manner of reasons for this. It could be  an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data are missing information about visitor numbers. Bear in mind,  the coefficient for skiable terrain is negative _for this model_. For example, if you kept the total number of chairs and fastQuads constant, but increased the skiable terrain extent, you might imagine the resort is worse off because the chairlift capacity is stretched thinner."

    "Time to select your final model to use for further business modeling! It would be good to revisit the above model selection; there is undoubtedly more that could be done to explore possible hyperparameters.\n",
    "It would also be worthwhile to investigate removing the least useful features. Gathering or calculating, and storing, features adds business cost and dependencies, so if features genuinely are not needed they should be removed.\n",
    "Building a simpler model with fewer features can also have the advantage of being easier to sell (and/or explain) to stakeholders.\n",
    "Certainly there seem to be four strong features here and so a model using only those would probably work well.\n",

    "\n",
    "Or, rather, you have two \"somethings\". You built a best linear model and a best random forest model. You need to finally choose between them. You can calculate the mean absolute error using cross-validation.

    "**Q: 1** Write a summary of the work in this notebook. Capture the fact that you gained a baseline idea of performance by simply taking the average price and how well that did. Then highlight that you built a linear model and the features that found. Comment on the estimate of its performance from cross-validation and whether its performance on the test split was consistent with this estimate. Also highlight that a random forest regressor was tried, what preprocessing steps were found to be best, and again what its estimated performance via cross-validation was and whether its performance on the test set was consistent with that. State which model you have decided to use going forwards and why. This summary should provide a quick overview for someone wanting to know quickly why the given model was chosen for the next part of the business problem to help guide important business decisions."

    "**A: 1** First, I split the data into a training set and test set, with the test set size being set to 30% of the full data set. The dependent variable of interest, ‘AdultWeekend’ ticket prices was assigned to y_train and y_test, as training and test dependent variables, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "A baseline ‘model’ was created to get a sense of performance when using the average of y_train to predict the ‘AdultWeekend’ price. The metrics, coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean square error (MSE) were used to evaluate the performance when using the mean. The R2 value showed that 2.4% of the variance in the ‘AdultWeekend’ price was explained by the model when using mean as a predictor. The MAE showed that on average, the prediction for ‘AdultWeekend’ could be off by ~$19 if the mean of the y_train was used to predict ‘AdultWeekend’ prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, a linear regression model was used to estimate ‘AdultWeekend’ prices. The linear regression model explained 80% of the variance in the training set and 70% of the variance in the test set. Use of a linear regression instead of the mean for modelling reduced the MAE from ~$19 to ~$10. When using a linear regression model, there was not a significant difference in model performance when independent missing values (in X_train) were substituted as the median or the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the high number of features, there was a concern that the model was overfitting. Sklearn’s SelectKBest function was used to select the optimal number of features to be used for training the model. The default value for k = 10; when this was used, the model performed worse than using all the features. Cross validation was used to find how the model performed on various segments of training data before using the model on test data. The estimated performance of the linear regression model was consistent using certain k values for validation and not consistent when using others. On average, the model performance was worse when estimated via cross validation (cv_score/R2 average = 62.2%), than when estimated on the test split (R2 = 66.2%),.\n",
    "\n",
    "A random forest regressor was also used for modelling. Median values of X_train were used to impute missing values in the data frame. StandardScaler was used to scale each feature to zero mean and unit variance. The estimated performance via cross validation was comparable to the performance on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dominant features in the model seemed to be Runs, fastQuads, vertical_drop, and snow making_ac. \n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating model performance based on MAE, random forest will be used for modelling going forward because its MAE is less than the linear regression model.\n"
